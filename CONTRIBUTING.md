# Contributing

First and foremost, **thank you** for considering contributing to this project!

We believe in the liberty of coding and want everyone to feel free to express themselves. We don't want to enforce strict, rigid rules that stifle creativity. Whether you have a new idea, a different approach, or just want to tweak something, you are welcome here.

## Branching Strategy

To make sure everyone can easily understand what's being worked on, we do have one simple request regarding branch names. It helps us keep things organized while you do your magic!

Please use the following naming conventions for your branches:

- **New Features**: `feature/add-my-cool-feature`
- **Bug Fixes**: `bug/fix-this-issue`

That's it! Feel free to open a Pull Request, raise an issue, start a discussion, or suggest changes. Happy coding!
